# FlippingGravity
This is a fun game originally made for a phone app, where you run as long as you can. You tap to flip and avoid the obstacles. The way I 
made this one was using Unity and some open source assets that I found. I was able to make it "endless" by building a certain amount of
prefabricated blocks. Then I have the blocks scroll from right to left, and every time one of the block is done a new one, picked at random
from the set of available blocks, is selected and placed at the end. 

I also enabled ads on this to try and generate revenue just in case it became the next big hit on the Android market. I never released it
to the Iphone because in Unity you need a Mac to deliver to a Mac. I also do not have an Apple ID, so both of those would have limited me.

# To Play
If you would like to play this simply clone the repository, then open up the /exe/ directory and click on the FlippingGravity.exe. This 
will then play the game for you. I only have the windows release on this repository, but you can go to
